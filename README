# Laravel API Project

This is a Laravel-based API project. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- PHP (version 8.0.2 or higher)
- Composer
- MySQL
- Node.js (optional, if you need frontend dependencies)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install PHP dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all required PHP dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Set up the `.env` file**:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Update the `.env` file with your database credentials and other configurations.

4. **Generate the application key**:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. **Seed the database**:
   Populate the database with initial data using the seeder:
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

7. **Start the development server**:
   Run the following command to start the Laravel development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

8. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Additional Notes

- If you encounter issues with JWT, ensure the `JWT_SECRET` in your `.env` file is set. You can generate a new secret using:
  ```bash
  php artisan jwt:secret
  ```

- For frontend dependencies (if applicable), run:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

- To stop the development server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Troubleshooting

- If migrations or seeds fail, ensure your database is running and the credentials in `.env` are correct.
- Clear the configuration cache if changes to `.env` are not reflected:
  ```bash
  php artisan config:clear
  php artisan cache:clear
  ```
